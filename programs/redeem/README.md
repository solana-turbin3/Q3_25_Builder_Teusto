# Redeem - Ticket Token Exchange Program

A Solana smart contract built with the Anchor framework that implements a comprehensive ticket token exchange system. Users can purchase ticket tokens with SOL and redeem them for real-world products, creating a bridge between digital assets and physical goods.

## Overview

The Redeem program establishes a token-based economy where SOL serves as the base currency for purchasing ticket tokens, which can then be exchanged for products in a managed catalog. This system provides businesses with a way to tokenize their product offerings while giving users a seamless experience for purchasing and redeeming digital vouchers.

### Core Functionality

- **Token Purchase**: Users invest SOL to receive ticket tokens at configurable exchange rates
- **Product Catalog**: Administrators can add products with specific ticket costs and inventory limits
- **Redemption System**: Users burn ticket tokens to claim products, with full audit trail
- **Balance Management**: Comprehensive tracking of user purchases, redemptions, and remaining balances

## Architecture

### Account Structure

The program uses four primary account types, each serving a specific role in the token economy:

#### System State (`Redeem`)
The central authority account that maintains global system configuration and statistics. This account stores the exchange rate, references to the ticket mint and SOL vault, and tracks total tickets minted and redeemed across the entire system.

#### Product Catalog (`Product`)
Individual accounts for each product available for redemption. These accounts contain product metadata, pricing in tickets, inventory levels, and availability status. Each product is identified by a unique ID and stored in a deterministic Program Derived Address.

#### User Accounts (`UserRedeemAccount`)
Personal accounts that track each user's ticket balance, purchase history, and redemption activity. These accounts are automatically created on first purchase and maintain comprehensive statistics about user engagement with the system.

#### Redemption Records (`RedemptionRecord`)
Immutable audit records created for each product redemption. These accounts provide a complete transaction history for compliance, customer service, and analytics purposes.

### Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)

The program extensively uses PDAs to create deterministic, program-owned accounts:

- **System State**: `["redeem"]`
- **SOL Vault**: `["sol_vault", redeem_account]`
- **Products**: `["product", product_id]`
- **User Accounts**: `["user_redeem", user_pubkey]`
- **Redemption Records**: `["redemption", user_pubkey, product_id, timestamp]`

This PDA structure ensures that accounts can be reliably located and prevents address collisions while maintaining security through program ownership.

## Token Economics

### Exchange Mechanism

The system implements a straightforward SOL-to-ticket exchange where users pay SOL to receive an equivalent number of ticket tokens based on the configured exchange rate. The exchange rate is set during system initialization and can range from 0.001 SOL to 1 SOL per ticket, providing flexibility for different economic models.

### Token Lifecycle

1. **Minting**: Ticket tokens are minted when users purchase them with SOL
2. **Circulation**: Tokens remain in user accounts and can be transferred like standard SPL tokens
3. **Burning**: Tokens are permanently destroyed when redeemed for products
4. **Supply Tracking**: The system maintains accurate counts of total minted and redeemed tokens

### Economic Controls

Several mechanisms prevent economic manipulation and ensure system stability:

- Exchange rate bounds prevent extremely low or high valuations
- Purchase limits restrict individual transaction sizes
- Product cost limits ensure reasonable pricing
- Inventory controls prevent overselling

## Security Model

### Access Control

The program implements role-based access control with two primary roles:

- **System Authority**: Can initialize the system, add products, and modify system parameters
- **Users**: Can purchase tickets and redeem products they own

### Input Validation

All user inputs undergo rigorous validation:

- Exchange rates must fall within predefined economic bounds
- Purchase amounts are limited to prevent spam and whale attacks
- Product parameters are validated for reasonableness
- String inputs are length-constrained to prevent buffer overflows

### Mathematical Safety

The program employs checked arithmetic throughout to prevent integer overflow attacks:

- All multiplication operations use `checked_mul()`
- Addition operations use `checked_add()` where overflow is possible
- Subtraction uses saturating operations to prevent underflow

### State Consistency

Atomic operations ensure that state changes are all-or-nothing:

- Failed transactions leave no partial state changes
- Account updates are batched within single instructions
- Cross-program invocations use proper error propagation

## Technical Implementation

### Instruction Set

#### Initialize
Sets up the entire system infrastructure including the main state account, ticket token mint, and SOL collection vault. This instruction can only be called once and establishes the economic parameters for the entire system lifecycle.

#### Purchase Tickets
Handles the core value exchange where users provide SOL and receive ticket tokens. The instruction automatically creates user accounts on first purchase and maintains comprehensive purchase statistics.

#### Add Product
Allows system administrators to expand the product catalog with new offerings. Each product receives a unique account with configurable pricing, inventory, and metadata.

#### Redeem Product
Executes the redemption process where users burn ticket tokens to claim products. This instruction updates inventory, creates audit records, and emits events for external system integration.

### Cross-Program Invocations

The program integrates with several Solana native programs:

- **System Program**: For account creation and SOL transfers
- **Token Program**: For SPL token operations (mint, burn, transfer)
- **Associated Token Program**: For automatic token account creation

### Event Emission

The program emits structured events for off-chain integration:

- Product redemption events include user, product, timestamp, and transaction details
- Events enable real-time monitoring and external system synchronization

## Development Patterns

### Modular Architecture

The codebase is organized into logical modules:

- `state.rs`: Account structures and business logic methods
- `constants.rs`: System parameters, validation functions, and utilities
- `instructions/`: Individual instruction handlers in separate files
- `lib.rs`: Program entry point and public API

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling with custom error codes:

- Business logic errors (insufficient funds, out of stock)
- Security errors (unauthorized access, invalid parameters)
- System errors (overflow, invalid state)

### Code Documentation

Extensive inline documentation explains:

- Account structure and constraints
- Instruction flow and security checks
- Business logic and economic implications
- PDA derivation and seed usage

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Setup

The program requires:

- Solana CLI tools for deployment
- Anchor framework (v0.31.1 or later)
- Node.js environment for testing and client integration

### Configuration

Key deployment parameters:

- Program ID (generated during deployment)
- Initial exchange rate (set during initialization)
- System authority (deployer by default)

### Testing Strategy

Comprehensive testing should cover:

- Happy path scenarios for all instructions
- Error conditions and edge cases
- Economic boundary testing
- Security validation

## Integration Guide

The program generates TypeScript definitions for easy client integration:

- Account structure types
- Instruction parameter interfaces
- Error code enumerations

### Frontend Integration

Web applications can integrate using:

- Anchor TypeScript client
- Solana Web3.js for transaction handling
- Wallet adapters for user authentication

### Backend Services

Server applications can:

- Monitor redemption events
- Track system statistics
- Implement business logic for product fulfillment

## Economic Modeling

### Revenue Streams

The system enables several business models:

- Direct product sales through ticket redemption
- Premium pricing through ticket scarcity
- Loyalty programs with bonus ticket distribution

### Analytics

Built-in tracking provides insights into:

- User purchase patterns
- Product popularity and redemption rates
- System utilization and token velocity

### Scalability

The architecture supports growth through:

- Unlimited product catalog expansion
